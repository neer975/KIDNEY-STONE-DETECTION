Pipeline 4 Notebook - AutoAI Notebook v1.22.9
Consider these tips for working with an auto-generated notebook:

Notebook code generated using AutoAI will execute successfully. If you modify the notebook, we cannot guarantee it will run successfully.
This pipeline is optimized for the original data set. The pipeline might fail or produce sub-optimal results if used with different data. If you want to use a different data set, consider retraining the AutoAI experiment to generate a new pipeline. For more information, see Cloud Platform.
Before modifying the pipeline or trying to re-fit the pipeline, consider that the code converts dataframes to numpy arrays before fitting the pipeline (a current restriction of the preprocessor pipeline).

Notebook content
This notebook contains a Scikit-learn representation of AutoAI pipeline. This notebook introduces commands for retrieving data, training the model, and testing the model.

Some familiarity with Python is helpful. This notebook uses Python 3.10 and scikit-learn 1.1.1.
